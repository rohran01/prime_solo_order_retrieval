<p>Address Display</p>


I would like the addresses on file for <select ng-model="idSelected" ng-change="getAddresses()" ng-options="person as person.name for person in people track by person.id"></select>

<ul>
    <li ng-repeat="address in addresses">
        <b>{{address.address_type}}</b><br>
        {{address.address_street}}<br>
        {{address.address_city}} , {{address.address_state}} {{address.address_zip}}
    </li><br><br>
</ul>
